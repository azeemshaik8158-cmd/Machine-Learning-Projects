# Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis  

This project is about analyzing Amazon product reviews and predicting whether a review is positive, negative, or neutral using Machine Learning and NLP techniques.  
The goal of this project is to understand customer opinions and build a model that can classify review sentiments effectively.

## 📌 Business Problem  
E-commerce platforms like Amazon receive millions of customer reviews every day.  
Manually reading and understanding them is not practical. Sentiment analysis helps businesses to:

- Understand customer satisfaction levels  
- Identify negative feedback early  
- Improve product quality and services  
- Support data-driven decision making

## 📂 Dataset  

**Source:** Amazon product reviews dataset  

**Data Type:**  
Text reviews with sentiment labels  

**Target Variable:**  
Sentiment →  
- Positive  
- Negative  
- Neutral  

The main focus of this project is on the review text and its corresponding sentiment label.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach  
This is a text classification problem.

Steps I followed:
1. Text cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Removing noise such as punctuation and stopwords  
3. Tokenization  
4. Converting text to numerical vectors  
5. Splitting data into training and testing sets  
6. Training ML models  
7. Evaluating performance

## 🤖 Models Used  
I experimented with the following models:
- Logistic Regression  
- Naive Bayes  
- Random Forest (if used)

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation  
Evaluation metrics used:
- Accuracy  
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix

## ⭐ Key Learning    
From this project, I learned:
- How to clean and preprocess text data properly  
- How to convert text into numerical features and feed it into ML models  
- How evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score actually reflect model performance  
- How model performance changes with different preprocessing and feature extraction techniques
