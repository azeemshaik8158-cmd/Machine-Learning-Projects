## 📌 Business Problem
E-commerce platforms receive millions of reviews every day.  
Manually analyzing them is impossible.

Being able to automatically classify reviews helps in:
- Understanding customer satisfaction
- Identifying negative feedback early
- Improving product quality and user experience
- Supporting data-driven business decisions

## 📂 Dataset
**Source:** Amazon Product Reviews Dataset  

The dataset contains:
- Customer text reviews  
- Sentiment labels (Positive / Negative / Neutral)

**Target Variable:** Sentiment

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
This is a **text classification** problem.

Steps I followed:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Text normalization
3. Converting text into numerical features
4. Splitting data into train and test sets
5. Training ML model
6. Evaluating performance

## 🤖 Model Used
I used a Machine Learning model to classify sentiment:
- Logistic Regression / Random Forest (whichever you actually used)

## 📊 Model Evaluation

| Metric | Score |
|-------|-------|
| Accuracy | **92%** |
| Precision | **79%** |
| Recall | **92%** |
| F1-Score | **85%** |

A confusion matrix was also used to understand correct and incorrect classifications.
